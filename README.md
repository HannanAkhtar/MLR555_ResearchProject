# Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning (C-GRL) for Imbalanced Classification

This repository contains Jupyter notebook implementations of **Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning (C-GRL)** - a deep RL framework designed to handle extreme class imbalance in classification tasks. The model is benchmarked on two real-world medical datasets: Stroke Prediction and Vitamin A Deficiency (VitA).

| `LoadingVitA.ipynb`                   | Loads and preprocesses the VitA dataset          |
| `Dueling DDQN Stroke-2024.ipynb`      | Dueling DDQN training on the Stroke dataset      |
| `Dueling DDQN Vitamin A.ipynb`        | Dueling DDQN training on the VitA dataset        |
| `C-GRL Implementation.ipynb`          | Full C-GRL training with curriculum and PER      |

## Key Features

- **Curriculum Learning**: Trains progressively from balanced to imbalanced settings.
- **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Focuses on high-TD-error samples.
- **Dynamic Reward Scaling**: Adjusts class-wise reward magnitude based on imbalance ratio.
- **Dueling Double DQN Backbone**: Separates state value and action advantage.

## Datasets

- **Stroke Dataset**: Predictive classification of stroke risk based on clinical variables.
- **Vitamin A Deficiency Dataset**: Binary classification of VAD using symptom data from schoolchildren in Niger.
